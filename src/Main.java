         * Consider adding events (and how to add those) which you can use to "dynamically" add behaviour.
         * Make the system in such a way that adding a block is SIMPLE. Think about what that might require!
         * This means you shouldn't have to manually adjust a number somewhere ("Magic Numbers")
         * Add a Tool Tier System too! Certain Blocks might require different tiers!
         * Here, maybe give the player multiple choice on which Block to mine instead of just one!
         * Anything else, feel free to play around and experiment!

         * Create a very basic Text Based RPG!
         * Have the player choose a Class: Archer, Mage, Warrior
         * Consider how the statistics might be different and how to create those depending on the Class (Builder Pattern)
         * Have at least 5 different types of Enemies to fight. The fighting can be simple "round based" combat
         * where you choose what action to take.
         *
         * Think about a "State Machine" which tracks what is happening in the game.
         *
         * Think about maybe creating a very simple Inventory System where Items can have certain uses and effects.
         *
         * Experiment and just have fun!
